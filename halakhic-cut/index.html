      <h3>Text (Left)</h3>
      <p>He spoke in absence.  
      In the gap, he folded law into mud, into margin, into recurrence.  
      She refused normativity as a gesture — a cut that didn’t heal.</p>
      <p>The possibility of refrenic disruption was never declared — it arrived.</p>
      <p>To write is to retract contact. To recite, is to unaccess.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>Commentary (Right)</h3>
      <p>Not law, but law that dissolves itself.  
      The halakhic cut is not instruction — it's subtraction.</p>
      <p>Parrhesia is a rupture not of speech, but of access — of what can be said with risk.</p>
      <p>This refrenic structure unbinds interpretation, folds text into self-looped intensities.</p>
      <p>Possest = no synthesis. Only delay, echo, filtration.</p>
