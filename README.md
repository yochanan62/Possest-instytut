# Possest Institute (PQF)

This is a living repository of **bifurcational topology**, **parrhesiastic singularity**, and **non-formal knowledge access**.

Each folder is a **filtration axis**.  
Each `.md` file is a **trajectory**, **rupture**, or **operator**.  
There are no categories — only accessible intensities.

## 🔧 Operators in Use

| Symbol   | Name                       | Description                                         |
| -------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `δ*`     | Recursive bifurcation cut  | Local disruption and redirection of access flow     |
| `Ψ`      | Refrenic memory            | Non-linear pattern storage without representation   |
| `ℑ_mukh` | Mukhālafa Operator         | Filters unresolved proximity into normativity shock |
| `𝔇`      | Domain of potential access | Always restructured by tension, never static        |
| `Tissou` | Infinite resonance         | Site of unresolved filtration, never collapses      |
