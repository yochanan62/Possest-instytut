> Books, cinema, citation, and nonhuman filtration.

This paper explores **nonhuman epistemology** through the symbolic topology of the **swamp** — as both site and signal of filtration failure.

Drawing on fragments from American cinema, halakhic discontinuity, and **filtrational bifurcation**, it articulates a language of inaccessibility shaped by **arrest**, **delay**, and **immersive obstruction**.
