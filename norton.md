# Physics of the Non-Physical

📄 [Download PDF](norton.pdf)

This work revisits Einstein’s Hole Argument and critiques physics’ metric dependency. PQF offers an ontology where spacetime is the scar of recursive filtration — not a ground, but residue.

## Keywords

`δ*`, `metric`, `event`, `recursion`, `Einstein`, `Norton`, `fold`

## Fragment

> “An event is not something that happens. It’s how filtration folds inward.”

## Model

```math
Event := crease in the recursive topology of access
```
