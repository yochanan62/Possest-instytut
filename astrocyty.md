# From Neurons to Fields

📄 [Download PDF](astrocyty.pdf)

Astrocytes, not neurons, emerge as primary operators of recursive access. This paper proposes a fundamental reconception of cognition as a field of glial-immunological folds, not synaptic nodes.

## Keywords

`astrocytes`, `δ*`, `Dastro`, `recursive access`, `filter`, `non-neuronal intelligence`

## Fragment

> “The neuron is the flicker. The astrocyte is the fire.”

## Model

```math
δ^*_k ≥ Θ_k ⇒ Access enabled within D_{astro}
```
