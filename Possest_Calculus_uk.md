# Possest Calculus

📄 [Download PDF](Possest_Calculus_uk.pdf)

A foundational exposition of Possest Calculus: empiricity as residue of filtration rather than structured data. Reconstructs perception, biology, and even physics through reorganizational delay and recursive tension.

## Keywords

`δ*`, `Θ`, `empiricity`, `recursive filtration`, `possest`, `catastrophic access`

## Fragment

> “To appear is not to be. It is to momentarily survive reorganizational collapse.”

## Model

```math
δ^*_k ≥ Θ ⇨ bifurcation ⇨ survived appearance
```
